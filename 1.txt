The world’s leading technology companies have made Ireland a global center of innovation, and the country’s ability to attract investment continues to grow its specialized tech clusters.
When California-based medtech company Dexcom announced in May that it will build a state-of-the-art facility in the Irish town of Athenry, County Galway, it signaled recognition of the country’s leading role at the intersection of technology and health care.

Dexcom is the world leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring for people with diabetes, and its $327 million investment in Athenry adds to the growing international status of Galway’s remarkable cluster of around 20 medtech companies that comprise a hub of health care expertise on Ireland’s west coast.

The facility’s creation of up to 1,000 high-tech jobs will leverage the abundance of technologists in Ireland’s young workforce. “Ireland has an exceptional talent pool and an established medtech sector, making Athenry the perfect location for us,” says Barry Regan, Dexcom’s Executive Vice President of Global Operations.

Bloomberg’s 2023 global study of FDI investors found that 51% of those planning to invest in Ireland within the next one to three years are motivated by Ireland’s expertise in advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, compared to 36% of FDI investors globally.

This high level of FDI interest is a direct consequence of the Irish government’s long-term commitment to placing technology at the heart of its economic strategy, which helped Ireland’s GDP grow by 12% in 2022.

“Critically, successive Irish governments have underlined their commitment to and partnership with enterprise,” says Michael Lohan, CEO of IDA Ireland, the country's investment promotion agency. “This allows companies to fully embrace key opportunities, such as those sectors associated with the green and digital transitions.”
